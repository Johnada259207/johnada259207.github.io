You can make multiple HTML files and link them to each other through KompoZer
(and make it look way better than Emy's lol)

Also if you plan to use more images/gifs, it might be better to have a folder for them
or maybe a folder for each new page you make so that stuff stays together
and anything INDEX.HTML will stay in ROOT
